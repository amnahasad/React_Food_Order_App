The user can select the item(s) they would like to order and its quantity and press the 'Add to Cart' button to place it into the cart. The user can add as many items they would like to the cart. The user can click on the 'Your Cart' button at the top of the page to view the items inside their cart. In the Cart, the user can view the price of all the items and the total balance. Inside the Cart window, the user can add more quantity of an item into their cart by clicking the '+' button. Similarly, the user can enter the '-'  button to remove an item from the cart.
